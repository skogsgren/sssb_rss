=== SSSB RSS feed generator for apartment listings ===

generate an rss feed for the apartment listings for Stockholm student
housing (https://sssb.se).

== USAGE ==

if you only want to run it once, then first install dependencies, e.g.
using pip:

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

then run the sssb.py file and provide where you want the feed xml to be
saved (or updated if it already exists), e.g. to save it to a file
called feed.xml in the current folder:

    python3 sssb.py ./feed.xml

however, I created it to generate and update an already existing rss
file situated on a web server. to do that, go into update_rss and update
$REMOTE_FILE to the correct locations for your server. then run:

    ./update_rss

or, even better if you're on linux: use the systemd services/timers in
the systemd folder. just copy them to $XDG_CONFIG/systemd/user and then
follow https://gist.github.com/oprypin/0f0c3479ab53e00988b52919e5d7c144

make sure to replace $GIT_DIR with the actual location though, first.

== TROUBLESHOOTING ==

currently the script loads the jquery url from a file called 'url'. This
url might need to be updated in the future. either open an issue if it's
not working or find it yourself by searching for 'callback' in the
network tab of developer tools as you load the listings webpage (with
pictures).
