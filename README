=== SSSB RSS feed generator for apartment listings ===

generate an rss feed for the apartment listings for Stockholm student
housing (https://sssb.se)

crawls using selenium since the apartment listings are generated
dynamically. I put the make.sh script in my crontab to run twice a day
to update the rss file on my web server.

== USAGE ==

if you only want to run it once, then first create a venv and install
dependencies:

    python3 -m venv crawl_venv
    source crawl_venv/bin/activate
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

then run the sssb.py file and provide where you want the feed xml to be
saved, for example to save it to a file called feed.xml in the current
folder:

    python3 sssb.py ./feed.xml

however, I created it to generate and update an already existing rss
file situated on a web server. to do that, go into make.sh and change
the two variables $TMP_PATH and $VENV_PATH to the correct locations for
your machine. then you just run:

    ./make.sh

the make script depends on notify-send to send notifications on the
exit status of the script.
