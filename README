=== SSSB RSS feed generator for apartment listings ===

generate an rss feed for the apartment listings for Stockholm student
housing (https://sssb.se).

I put the make.sh script in my crontab to run twice a day to update the
rss file on my web server.

== USAGE ==

if you only want to run it once, then first  install dependencies, e.g.
using pip:

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

then run the sssb.py file and provide where you want the feed xml to be
saved (or updated if it already exists), e.g. to save it to a file
called feed.xml in the current folder:

    python3 sssb.py ./feed.xml

however, I created it to generate and update an already existing rss
file situated on a web server. to do that, go into make.sh and update
the variables to the correct locations for your machine. then you run:

    ./make.sh

the make script depends on notify-send to send notifications on the
exit status of the script. remove those if not needed.

== TROUBLESHOOTING ==

currently the script loads the jquery url from a file called 'url'. This
url might need to be updated in the future. either open an issue if it's
not working or find it yourself by searching for 'callback' in the
network tab of developer tools as you load the listings webpage (with
pictures).
