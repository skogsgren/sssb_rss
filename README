=== SSSB RSS Feed Generator For APT Listings ===

Generate an RSS feed for the apartment listings for Stockholm Student
Housing (https://sssb.se)

Crawls using Selenium since the apartment listings are generated
dynamically. I put the make.sh script in my crontab to run twice a day
to update the RSS file on my web server.

Adjust the make file to point to your web server (and to the Windows
temp folder if using Windows, not it assumes /tmp exists). The make
script depends on notify-send to send notifications on the exit status
of the script.

== USAGE ==

python3 sssb.py PATH_TO_FEED_FILE

or just by running ./make.sh
